          Roger Federer will retire next week at the age of 41 after the Laver
          Cup in London, marking the end of one of the greatest ever sporting
          careers. 
        </p>
          <p>A 20-time grand slam champion, Federer announced in a social
          media post on Thursday that next week will be his last as a
          professional player.
        </p>
          <p></p>Federer’s management firm, Team8, are founders of
          the Laver Cup, a Ryder Cup-style event. Roger Federer collapses to the
          ground after he defeated Pete Sampras on Centre Court The Joy of Six:

        <p>
          “The Laver Cup next week in London will be my
          final ATP event. I will play more tennis in the future, of course, but
          just not in Grand Slams or on the tour,” he wrote. Federer has not
          competed since Wimbledon last year when he lost 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-0 in
          the quarter-final to Hubert Hurkacz and it emerged he had reinjured
          the knee that had kept him out of the tour for more than a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Federer has contested five events since January 2020 and has undergone
          three knee surgeries in that period. He cited his late-career injury
          problems as the reason for his retirement. “The past three years have
          presented me with challenges in the form of injuries and surgeries.
          I’ve worked hard to return to full competitive form,” wrote Federer.
          “But I also know my body’s capacities and limits, and its message to
          me lately has been clear. I am 41 years old. I have played more than
          1500 matches over 24 years. Tennis has treated me more generously than
          I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognize when it is time to
          end my competitive career.” For a large period Federer held the men’s
          record for total grand slam titles, outpacing his idol, Pete Sampras,
          the previous record holder whose count of 14 was once considered to be
          almost untouchable. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout his career he unlocked other records
          that stand as a marker of his consistency and excellence, such as
          reaching 23 consecutive grand slam semi-finals and 36 consecutive
          quarter-finals. Federer has won 103 ATP singles titles, 28 ATP Masters
          titles and six ATP Finals. Of his 1,526 matches on the ATP tour, he
          compiled a 1251-275 (82%) singles record.
