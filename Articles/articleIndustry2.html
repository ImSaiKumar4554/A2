            Housing sales data from the Toronto region suggests markets will
            likely favour buyers given the sudden increase in listings — some
            are even calling it a buyers’ market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Homebuyers’ choices have undoubtedly improved, but affordability has
            not improved as much. For markets to be fully on the buyers’ side,
            they need plenty of choice and affordability. Thousands more homes
            are available to purchase, but most remain out of reach of
            mid-income earners.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a 32 per cent increase in listings in September, according
            to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB), dropping the
            sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) to 28.6 per cent. The industry
            rule of thumb says an SNLR of less than 40 per cent favours buyers
            and more than 60 per cent to favour sellers. Going just by that
            rule, it looks like a buyers’ market.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same report also said the average Toronto home price in
            September increased by three per cent from August. The average has
            increased by almost eight per cent since January. If housing was
            unaffordable earlier, it is still unaffordable.
