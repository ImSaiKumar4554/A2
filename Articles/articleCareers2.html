            Noticing a labour shortage? Here's what's really going on in
            Ontario's job market

            The vast majority of workers in Ontario haven't experienced anything
            quite like it their entire working lives: a labour market tilted in
            their favour. Statistics show unemployment running as low as it's
            ever been, record-high job vacancy numbers and unprecedented labour
            force participation rates. The labour market is "the tightest it's
            been in half a century, and it's not unique to Ontario," says
            economist Armine Yalnizyan. "It's happening all through the global
            north, wherever there was a baby boom after the Second World War."

            "There's a traffic jam of employers looking to hire," says Brendon
            Bernard, senior economist at Indeed, a job-search website. This
            profound shift in the job market has implications for just about
            everybody, whether you're an ordinary worker, an employer, a
            political leader, or someone waiting to get care in a hospital or
            service in a restaurant. It could bring about significant changes in
            the world of work — from recruitment tactics to workplace culture to
            salaries — but that largely depends on how governments and employers
            respond.

            Premier Doug Ford spoke of "endless employment opportunities" in
            Ontario during a news conference in Brampton last month. "You could
            walk down every street in this province and find a job in every
            single sector. We need 380,000 people to fill the existing jobs that
            we have right now," Ford said.

            The most recent figures from Statistics Canada show 372,000 job
            vacancies in Ontario during the third quarter of 2022. That's nearly
            double the average number of vacancies (195,000) reported during the
            three years leading up to 2020.
