            Healthcare workers and professional and technical services are in
            big demand in Ontario meaning job hunters are eyeing new
            opportunities compared to the start of the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            TD Economics’ latest forecast says real GDP growth in Ontario will
            slow from 2.9 per cent to 0.7 per cent next year and fare only
            marginally better in 2024, with 1 per cent growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “After a strong first half, economic growth in Ontario is poised to
            slow sharply in the coming quarters,” wrote economists Beata
            Caranci, Derek Burleton, Rishi Sondhi, Jenny Duan in the forecast.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the face of that slowing of the economy, the unemployment rate in
            Ontario is expected to gradually nudge up from 5.6 per cent over the
            next two years to 6.3 per cent in 2023 and then 6.7 per cent in
            2024. Home sales are expected to take a hit, dropping by a third by
            the end of this year and falling another 16.4 per cent next year
            before finally climbing back out of that slump in 2024.
