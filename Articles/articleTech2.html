          <h1>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: practically peerless</h1>

          <p>
            If the Samsung S22 Ultra was the ultimate evolution of a slab-style
            smartphone, then the Galaxy S23 Ultra is a victory lap — everything
            that the S22 was and a little extra.
          </p>
          <p>
            The S23 Ultra offers a handful of updates and a new main camera
            sensor. There are no groundbreaking new features. It doesn’t fold in
            half. Until someone invents radically improved battery technology or
            holographic displays, that’s just going to be the case for the Ultra
            for the foreseeable future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other side of that coin is that the S22 Ultra was already really
            good, and the S23 Ultra is a little better. Performance — delivered
            by a custom Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset — is whip fast. The updated
            camera system is capable of stunning feats. And a couple of small
            tweaks — the phone’s slightly reshaped side rails and screen — have
            a big impact on the device’s likability.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s all good news. The bad news is that it remains a very
            expensive device at $1,200, which is a bit more than a $1,099 iPhone
            14 Pro Max and a big leap from the Pixel 7 Pro’s $899 starting
            price. There are some familiar sore spots with Samsung software,
            like its insistence on including its own app store in addition to
            Google’s. And although the camera system can produce stunningly good
            images, it occasionally makes weird choices and comes up with a
            photo that’s just downright bad.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at the S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra side by side, you’ll see the
            slightly different shape on this year’s model — a display with a
            little less curve at the edges and side rails that are flatter. It
            doesn’t sound like much, but I think it makes a big difference. It
            feels much more secure in my fingers every time I pick it up off a
            table than the curvier S22 Ultra did. I realized I was actually
            bracing myself for it to slip out of my grasp every time I picked it
            up, which happened a lot with its predecessor. The S23 Ultra feels
            more secure as I pick it up but also in my hand as I’m using it,
            too, which is especially important when you’re writing on it with
            the S Pen.
          </p>
          <p>
            This slight flattening makes the S23 Ultra look a little boxier than
            the S22 Ultra, and you know what? I like it. In the cream color
            especially, it’s kind of late-’80s chic. I don’t know how else to
            describe it except for fancy. It feels worthy of a high price tag.
