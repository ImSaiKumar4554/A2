          <p>
            I prefer the soft-touch matte back glass on the Pro model (the Bay
            Blue color is my favorite), but the glossy Rose Pixel 8 is equally
            pretty. The latter has a much nicer size. The 6.2-inch screen feels
            wonderfully compact, and I wish you could get all of the Pro's
            features in this smaller package rather than having to bump up to
            the 6.7-inch screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The displays on both phones are colorful, sharp, and smooth, hitting
            a max refresh rate of 120 Hz, and they finally get bright enough for
            easy visibility in any lighting conditions. This is one of those
            things that always annoyed me on Pixels. You had to squint to see
            the screen when the sun was directly overhead. I didn't have that
            problem this time, finally.
          </p>
          <p>
            New in these phones is Face Unlock. If you recall, the Pixel 4 was
            the only Pixel to ever have Face Unlock as a secure biometric
            authentication you could use to access banking apps and other
            sensitive services. Now it's available again on the Pixel 8 series
            and works in conjunction with the in-display fingerprint sensor on
            pretty much any app that supports biometric authentication. When one
            method doesn't work, you can just use the other. And yes, you will
            have to rely on the fingerprint authentication in low light.
            Google's Face Unlock can't come close to matching Apple's Face ID
            capabilities in dark rooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also new is a temperature sensor, though this is only available on
            the Pixel 8 Pro. I weirdly like having this feature on a phone. I
            can probably count on one hand the number of times I'll use it in a
            year, but it's nice knowing that I have the capability to sense a
            temp if the situation ever arises. So far, it hasn't. But it will!
            It will. Google says you can't use it to measure body temperature
            yet (I tried and it said I measured a hypothermic 90 degrees), but
            it has submitted the app to the US Food and Drug Administration for
            clearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've had no issues with performance on the Tensor G3 chipset. Pixels
            in the past tend to run hot under load, but the Pixel 8 series have
            yet to reach the kind of too-hot-to-touch temps I've seen on
            predecessors when running intensive tasks. I also haven't run into
            any of the connectivity issues I had with the Pixel 6.
          </p>
          <p>
            If battery life is important to you, I don't have great news. The
            Pixel 8's 4,575-mAh capacity battery can last about a full day with
            average use, but anyone heavily relying on their phone throughout
            the day will want to carry a power bank to keep it topped up. The
            Pixel 8 Pro fared much better with its larger 5,050-mAh cell,
            getting more than five and a half hours of screen on time (with some
            gaming mixed in), but I was hoping for even longer. It can get you
            through a day and then some, but nothing more. They both can
            recharge a little bit faster when you plug them in—I measured an
            hour and a half for the Pixel 8 Pro from 10 percent to full—but I
            usually stuck with wireless charging.
