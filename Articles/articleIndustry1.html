            Commercial real estate owners, battered by higher interest rates,
            are grappling with another big challenge in Canada: a property tax
            system that’s increasingly tilted against them, according to a
            report by Altus Group Ltd.
          </p>
          <p>
            In several of the country’s largest biggest cities — including
            Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver — commercial properties are taxed at
            more than three times the rate of residential ones. The average gap
            across 11 major cities has widened in the past year, the Canadian
            real estate data firm said in the study.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Ontario, the most populous province, the situation is exacerbated
            by a tax transparency issue because the government suspended new
            property valuations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Properties are
            currently taxed based on 2016 values, and it may be years before
            that’s fixed, Altus said — giving an unfair tax advantage to
            industrial properties that have seen their values soar since then,
            compared with office or retail owners.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tax inequity between commercial and residential is greatest in
            Montreal, the business and financial capital of Quebec, where
            commercial real estate is taxed at $34.51 per $1,000 of property
            value, compared with about $8 per for homes, according to the Altus
            analysis.
