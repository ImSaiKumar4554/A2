              <h4>Commercial real estate woes in Canada worsened by tax gap</h4>
              <p>
                Commercial real estate owners, battered by higher interest
                rates, are grappling with another big challenge in Canada: a

              <p>
                Housing sales data from the Toronto region suggests markets will
                likely favour buyers given the sudden increase in listings —
                some are even calling it a buyers’ market.
